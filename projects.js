		details: "I needed an archive for my projects, so I decided to create this site.\n\n## Designs\n---\n\nI did a little research on personal websites in the progress I got some inspiration from some portfolios.\n\nI got the card design idea from [my extenstion Roblokis](/?projectid=roblokis)  \nbut I modified it to work on home page to look a bit wider than the original design.\n\nwhen a project is clicked, I made it show info about the project with a details field written as markdown.\n\n#### Markdown functionality\n\nthe markdown used in this text is actually fully written by `my code`, I hate using libraries for simple functionality. I think they are very bloated with unnecessary operations.\n\n> I created a markdown function to learn a lot about regex.  \n> most basic markdown features are available (except tables)\n\neverything in the function is made with safety in mind,  \nit was made to level up my regex knowledge.\n\n# More\n---\n\nI didn't intend to make this site as a portfolio but let me know if I should.  \ncontact details in home page at the bottom :b\n\nif you want to visit my personal website you can [click here](/)  \nbut if you want to view the result of this project then click the visit button below\n\nas of this point you surely noticed I'm not a writer.  \nand everything above is made to make the project look cool.  \nbut thanks for reading this far :D",
